An implementation of a Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) measure for sets of overlapping clusters.

Fully described in:
   "Normalized Mutual Information to evaluate overlapping community finding algorithms"
   by Aaron F. McDaid, Derek Greene, Neil Hurley
   http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.2515

Our method is based on the method described in Appendix B at the end of:
  "Detecting the overlapping and hierarchical community structure in complex networks"
  by Andrea Lancichinetti, Santo Fortunato and János Kertész
  http://iopscience.iop.org/1367-2630/11/3/033015/


== Usage ==

  make onmi
  onmi FILE1 FILE2

The filesnames record the sets of communities. A typical use case is to have
the "true" communities in one file and and those found by your algorithm
in the other file. One line per community. The nodes are
separated by whitespace, and any non-whitespace characters may be used in the
node names.

    abstract = {Given the increasing popularity of algorithms for overlapping clustering, in
particular in social network analysis, quantitative measures are needed to
measure the accuracy of a method. Given a set of true clusters, and the set of
clusters found by an algorithm, these sets of clusters must be compared to see
how similar or different the sets are. A normalized measure is desirable in
many contexts, for example assigning a value of 0 where the two sets are
totally dissimilar, and 1 where they are identical. A measure based on
normalized mutual information, [1], has recently become popular. We demonstrate
unintuitive behaviour of this measure, and show how this can be corrected by
using a more conventional normalization. We compare the results to that of
other measures, such as the Omega index [2].},
